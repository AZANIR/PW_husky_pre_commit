# Optimizing Code Quality with Playwright, Husky, Linter, and Prettier: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of software development, maintaining code quality and efficiency is paramount. This article delves into the integration of Playwright for end-to-end testing, Husky for managing Git hooks, and ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting. These tools collectively ensure that your codebase remains clean and error-free, especially before commits.

## Setting Up the Environment

Setup project directory and initialize npm or yarn.

```bash
mkdir code-quality
cd code-quality
npm init -y
```

### Installing the Necessary Packages:

-   **Playwright**: A framework for automated browser testing. Install latest version of Playwright and initialize it in your project directory. Add example test scripts to verify installation.

    ```bash
    npm install playwright
    npm init playwright@latest
    npm pkg set scripts.test="npx playwright test"
    npm pkg set scripts.test-ui="npx playwright test --ui"
    npm pkg set scripts.test-debug="npx playwright test --debug"
    npm pkg set scripts.test-codegen="npx playwright codegen"
    ```

-   **ESLint**: A linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Initialize ESLint in your project directory and configure it to suit your project’s needs.

    ```bash
    npm install eslint --save-dev
    npm init @eslint/config
    npm pkg set scripts.lint="npx eslint ./tests --fix --color"
    ```

-   **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter. Install Prettier and configure it to suit your project’s needs. Add example test scripts and rc and ignore files to verify installation.

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
    node --eval "fs.writeFileSync('.prettierrc','{}\n')"
    node --eval "fs.writeFileSync('.prettierignore','# Ignore  rtifacts:\nbuild')"
    npm pkg set scripts.prettier="prettier --write --ignore-unknown ./tests"
    ```

-   **Husky**: Manages Git hooks to automate tasks like testing and linting before commits. Install Husky and initialize it in your project directory. Add example test scripts to verify installation.

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev husky
    npx husky install
    npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run prettier && npm run lint"
    ```

## Integration of Playwright tests

Playwright tests simulate how a user interacts with your web application. To get set up, write test scripts in JavaScript or TypeScript and configure Playwright to suit your project's needs. This includes specifying browsers to test and defining test suites.

## Setting Up Husky for Pre-Commit Checks

Husky intercepts Git commands to run scripts before actions such as commits. Above installed Husky and created a .huskyrc file or added Husky configurations to package.json. We defined a pre-commit interceptor that runs the commands we selected.

## Integrating Linter and Prettier

ESLint and Prettier ensure that your code meets established standards. We've installed and configured ESLint to suit your project's preferences and integrated Prettier with ESLint for automatic code formatting. Added Husky to our pre-commit hook to automate validation and formatting.

## Creating a Pre-Commit Workflow

The pre-commit workflow includes automatic code formatting using Prettier and ESLint checking. When a developer initiates a commit, Husky runs these tasks. Only if all checks pass is the commit considered successful, ensuring code quality and consistency.

## Best Practices

-   **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep all tools up-to-date to leverage the latest features and security updates.
-   **Collaborate on Configuration**: Ensure team consensus on ESLint rules and Prettier formatting to maintain consistency.
-   **Optimize Playwright Tests**: Write clear, concise tests that cover key functionalities.

## Conclusion

Integrating Playwright, Husky, ESLint, and Prettier streamlines the development process, enforces code standards, and ensures that every commit is of the highest quality. Adopting these tools and practices is a step towards more efficient, reliable, and maintainable code.
